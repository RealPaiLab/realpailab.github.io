The goal of the Pai lab is to improve clinical decision-making by understanding of how genotype impacts phenotype. We work at the intersection of data science and genomics, using one or more of these approaches:
* machine learning
* network-based methods and software for incorporating biological prior knowledge into predictive models
* software development for genomics data analysis and interpretation
* epigenomics of disease
